# Application Under Test  Qkart E-Commerce Application  - _Project Author (Darpan Sarode)_

## Project Name and Description:
E-Commerce QKART
The Application Under Test is an e-commerce platform offering diverse product selections to online shoppers.
The testing was directed at enhancing user experience and ensuring functional robustness.
Implemented tests for user login/registration, cart operations, product searches, product size validations, user terms & privacy checks, and ad presence upon successful checkout.
I used Selenium for thorough automation and TestNG for efficient test grouping and parameterization, ensuring coverage and efficient execution.

#### ---------------------------------------------
Implemented automated tests for functionalities like product search, editing user cart items, cart content persistence across sessions
Added log statements appropriately to aid in debugging any issues
Reused methods like searching for products, and adding items to the cart thus making the code more maintainable.

Placed appropriate wait statements in the code base to improve script synchronization
Implemented feature request to take screenshots before and after the test case and also capture screenshots in case of error
Performed automation tests/validations that span across different browser tabs and windows

Using TestNG to enable features like grouping, prioritizing, and parameterizing of tests
Scope of Work
Migrated existing Selenium test code to use the TestNG framework
Parameterized the test cases and used XML configuration to send the parameters dynamically
Created sanity and regression test groups
Utilised Test Listeners to take screenshots of different events

### Results -------------------------------------------------
Successfully executed over 2000 positive and negative test cases, ensuring comprehensive testing coverage and high-quality delivery
Detected and raised 500+ bugs in You-Tracker, resulting in a 90% bug-free release, exceeding the client's expectations
Conducted functional, sanity, retesting, and regression testing, contributing to a 25% increase in the software's stability and performance.
Ensured timely release of the build to the client after all testing was completed, resulting in a 100% on-time delivery record
